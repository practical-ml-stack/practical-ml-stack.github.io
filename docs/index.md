# Practical ML Stack

**Real-World Machine Learning for Industry Problems**

<div class="hero" markdown>

Move beyond toy datasets. Build production-ready ML systems that solve real business problems.

## The Problem We're Solving

You've completed the tutorials. You've trained models on IRIS, Titanic, and MNIST. You understand the algorithms.

**But when you face a real business problem, you're stuck.**

- How do you handle messy, incomplete data?
- What features actually matter for churn prediction?
- How do you deploy a model that serves millions of requests?
- What does "production-ready" even mean?

The gap between tutorial ML and industry ML is vast. This resource bridges that gap.

## What You'll Learn

<div class="use-case-grid" markdown>

<div class="use-case-card" markdown>

### :material-account-cancel: Churn Modelling

Predict which customers will leave before they do. Learn feature engineering for behavioral data, handling class imbalance, and building interpretable models for business stakeholders.

## How This Resource Is Different

| Traditional Tutorials | Practical ML Stack |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Clean, preprocessed datasets | Raw, messy real-world data |
| Focus on model accuracy | Focus on business impact |
| Single notebook experiments | End-to-end pipelines |
| Academic examples | Industry case studies |
| "Here's the code" | "Here's why this works" |

## Who This Is For

!!! success "This is for you if..."

    - You know Python and basic ML concepts (scikit-learn, pandas)
    - You've completed introductory ML courses or tutorials
    - You want to solve real problems, not just pass exams
    - You're preparing for ML engineering or data science roles
    - You're a practitioner looking to level up your skills

!!! warning "This might not be for you if..."

    - You're brand new to Python or programming
    - You're looking for theoretical deep-dives into algorithms
    - You want research-focused content (try [mlsysbook.ai](https://mlsysbook.ai) instead)
